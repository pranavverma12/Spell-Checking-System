After getting the list of maybe corrected words we will take out their probability using unigram and replace the misspelled word with the max probability of correct word. If, there is a tie between the distance and probability of two words we are explicitly taking the first correct word in the result array. Once we get the correct sentence, we are comparing the result with the test correct sentences to find out the accuracy of an algorithm. The accuracy of the first algorithm is **78.69%.** \n",

To do this, we will generate such word pairs from the given corpus or sentences preserving their sequences. These pairs are called bigrams. \n",

        "  -\tIn python nltk, we have an inbuilt function for same. I.e. nltk.bigrams() and to calculate probability we can use another inbuild function of nltk function ConditionalFreqDist, using this we can find the probability.\n",

        "  \n",
        "  -\tIt is the most efficient but it takes start probabilities (as per my understating which is given by the user) so we cannot use this model.\n",

        "  -\tThe process takes a word or a sentence as input, assigns a POS tag to the word or to each word within the sentence, and produces the tagged text as output. \n",

        "makes POS tagging a necessary function for advanced NLP applications. \n",
        "\n",
        "  -\tPOS tagging is useful for syntactical parsing as taggers scale back ambiguity from the parser's input sentence, which makes parsing quicker by creating the computational drawback smaller, and the result less ambiguous. It also resolves some ambiguities that are not addressed by the syntactical parser’s language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **4.\tSmoothing Methods:**\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -\tIn add-one smoothing, we add values in the numerator and denominator so that while calculating the probability of some word we will not get the zero probability even if the word is not available in the given sentence or corpus. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Modified Algorithm: **\n",
        "\n",
        "-\tAfter checking through the process of all the above different algorithms/methods I decide to go ahead with the POS Tagging because I believe that it will be helpful in increasing the accuracy as is it tagging each word with nouns, verbs, determinant, cardinal number etc. so it will beneficial for us to ignore the cardinal numbers and pronouns. \n",
        "\n",
        "-\t***For example***, in my first algorithm if a sentence contains a word “THRUSH” it will be converted to “house” as the house will have the maximum probability. But that should not happen, as “THRUSH” is a pronoun and has special meaning in the sentence, while the replaced word house don’t make any meaning in the sentence. Similarly, cardinal number “48” is getting converted into “4” maybe cardinal number has some meaning in the sentence and while converting that we are losing the correctness and meaning of the sentence.  \n",
        "\n",
        "-\tIn addition to, in first algorithm we are not aware of the thing that the word is converting to which part of speech, but in the modified version we can check that out too.\n",
        "\n",
        "For testing this and to check the accuracy we have done the pos tagging on test original data set and we are passing it to the unchanged correct function. Once the words gets corrected we are checking if the word has either “CD” or “NNP” tag. If they have we are ignoring them (assuming them as a correct). Than calculating the accuracy accordingly by using the formula i.e. no of correct word prediction/total number of words. \n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, after using POS tagging we are getting an accuracy of **90.05 %**.\n"
